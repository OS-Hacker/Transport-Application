Transport Application
Overview
This is a transport application built with a well-structured approach to provide seamless user and admin functionalities. The project is divided into two main sections: frontend for the client-side code and backend for server-side operations. The application is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, ensuring a robust user experience.

Frontend
The frontend is developed using React and organized into neatly structured folders for better maintainability:

components: Contains reusable React components for efficient development.

admin: Contains all admin-related components and functionalities.

pages: Contains individual page components and routes.

Features:
State Management: Utilized Context API, a built-in feature of React, for state sharing across components.

Styling: Implemented a combination of Bootstrap for responsive layouts and styled-components for custom, reusable styles.

Routing: Used react-router-dom for seamless navigation and efficient route management.

User Experience Enhancements:

react-icons: Integrated for visually appealing and intuitive icons.

GSAP Animations: Added small animations, such as transitions and hover effects, for a dynamic user interface.

Backend
The backend is designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and readability.

Key Features:
User Authentication & Authorization:

Built a User model for user registration (signup) and login.

Secured routes with middleware for authentication and authorization.

Used bcrypt to hash passwords for enhanced security.

Employed JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure admin authorization and role-based access.

Transport Management:

Developed a Transport model to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for transportation data.

Booking Management:

Designed a Booking model for users to create bookings, view booking history, and retrieve details.

Admin functionalities include:

Viewing all bookings.

Updating booking statuses (e.g., Confirm, Cancel).

Managing customer bookings efficiently.

Backend Best Practices:

Input validation to ensure data integrity.

Comprehensive error handling for robust application behavior.

Database indexing for optimized query performance, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
